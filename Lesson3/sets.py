# SET METHODS


# Create a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

# Adding 7 to the end of the set
my_set.add(7)

# Removing 3 from the set
my_set.remove(3)

# Removing 8 from the set without throwing an error if 8 is now in the set
my_set.discard(8)

print(my_set)  # Output: {1,2,7}

# Removes all the elements
my_set.clear()

set_length = len(my_set)
print(set_length)  # Output: 0

# Removing duplicates from a list

# Create a list that contains duplicates
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]

# Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
unique_set = set(my_list)

# Convert the set back to a list

print(unique_list)  # Output [1,2,3,4,5]

# Checking for common elements
