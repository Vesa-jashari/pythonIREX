# Write a program that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10

# Initialize a variable to store the total sum
total = 0

# Iterate through numbers from 1 to 10
for number in range(1, 11):
    # Check if the number is even
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # Add the even number to the total sum
        total += number

# Print the result
print("The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is:", total)
